# PageRank-Algorithm
It is a python module focused on the sensitivity of teleportation parameter α in Google’s PageRank Algorithm.
My research emphasises on the simple sensitivity measure of the PageRank vector’s derivative after written as a function as α, and further explores the properties of its second derivatives. Also, influences of the choice of α on the iteration times and potential problems (eg. rank sinks and cycles) are researched extensively, and selected webpages are ranked according to their calculated PageRank value.
